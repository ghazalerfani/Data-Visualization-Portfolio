# Data-Visualization-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is Ghazal (she, her, hers) and I'm part of the Master of Information Systems - Business Intelligence & Data Analytics 12 Month Master's program at Heinz College at CMU. I'm a 27 year old Iranian-American who loves all things data. I'm also an avid yogi, basketball player, and climber. 

Upon graduation in August 2019, I hope to use my technical expertise, communication skills, and drive to innovate in a community that works for the betterment of society—a place that brings people together and uses the latest data technologies and techniques to solve unique problems and affect change. 

# What I hope to learn
I have been lucky enough to learn so much about analyzing and deriving insights from data throughout my Master's program. Having grasped the complexities of the data world, I now hope to learn how to better communicate these complex ideas in the most effective and digestible manner possible to enable people to make better decisions.
