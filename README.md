# Data-Visualization-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is Ghazal (she, her, hers) and I'm part of the Master of Information Systems - Business Intelligence & Data Analytics 12 Month Master's program at Heinz College at CMU. I'm a 27 year old Iranian-American who loves all things data. I'm also an avid yogi, basketball player, and climber. 

Upon graduation in August 2019, I hope to use my technical expertise, communication skills, and drive to innovate in a community that works for the betterment of society—a place that brings people together and uses the latest data technologies and techniques to solve unique problems and affect change. 

# What I hope to learn
I have been lucky enough to learn so much about analyzing and deriving insights from data throughout my Master's program. Having grasped the complexities of the data world, I now hope to learn how to better communicate these complex ideas in the most effective and digestible manner possible to enable people to make better decisions. 

# Portfolio
Here is where all my cool data visualizations will go!

## Critique #1
<iframe title="Social Media: Transformation in The Labour Party" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a7XeD/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="291"></iframe>

This redesigned visualization aims to provide more contexually aware information in a straightforward, digestible manner.

## Critique #2
<iframe title="'Big Three' Blamed for Most Attacks" aria-label="Interactive donut chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TRNNj" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TRNNj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="424"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

This redesigned visualization improves upon the original in the following ways:

1. Introduces only 3 shark types to the audience, rather than an overwhelming 33. 
2. Uses a donut chart to make shark type attacks easier to compare to one another and illustrate the dominance of the big three shark types. 
3. Separates Fatal and Nonfatal attacks into two parts to make each more digestible. 
4. Explicitly writes the number of attacks by each shark type to make it more tangible. 
5. Allows the user to interact with parts of the donut chart to encourage engagement.

## Data Visualization #1: Office of Inspector General
### 1. Time Magazine Journalist
<script id="infogram_0_337c48c9-3c60-4809-842e-adcd5d23a939" title="OIG: Journalist" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?NHT" type="text/javascript"></script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/337c48c9-3c60-4809-842e-adcd5d23a939" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">OIG: Journalist</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

This visualization would be published in Time Magazine. Given that Time Magazine is a weekly publication that targets people who are well-educated and in professional jobs with salaries above the median salary, it aims to provide a timely notification of the worsening conditions at Rio Grande Valley. It contextualizes the current conditions by showing the percent increase in apprehensions over one year and uses the color to red to illustrate the urgency of the situation. 

### 2. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Analyst
<script id="infogram_0_7b7ea43c-cdec-415f-9b19-5c52800ac578" title="OIG: Analyst" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?liR" type="text/javascript"></script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/7b7ea43c-cdec-415f-9b19-5c52800ac578" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">OIG: Analyst</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

This visualization would be used by high-level policy-makers at DHS and other government agencies to give them a snapshot of the current conditions at Rio Grande Valley and how they compare to standards that are currently in place to prevent such overcrowding. Given that such high-level policy-makers don't have much time, this visualization is concise and does not take much time to take in, but clearly shows that an alarming rate of detainees are being held over the permitted 72 hours. Once again, the use of the color red creates a sense of urgency. Seeing such a visualization would cause the policy-maker want to know more about current conditions and do what they can do bring the numbers down to the permitted level of 72 hours of detainment.
