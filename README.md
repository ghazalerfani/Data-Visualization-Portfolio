# Data-Visualization-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is Ghazal (she, her, hers) and I'm part of the Master of Information Systems - Business Intelligence & Data Analytics 12 Month Master's program at Heinz College at CMU. I'm a 27 year old Iranian-American who loves all things data. I'm also an avid yogi, basketball player, and climber. 

Upon graduation in August 2019, I hope to use my technical expertise, communication skills, and drive to innovate in a community that works for the betterment of society—a place that brings people together and uses the latest data technologies and techniques to solve unique problems and affect change. 

# What I hope to learn
I have been lucky enough to learn so much about analyzing and deriving insights from data throughout my Master's program. Having grasped the complexities of the data world, I now hope to learn how to better communicate these complex ideas in the most effective and digestible manner possible to enable people to make better decisions. 

# Portfolio
Here is where all my cool data visualizations will go!

## Critique #1
<iframe title="Social Media: Transformation in The Labour Party" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a7XeD/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="291"></iframe>

This redesigned visualization aims to provide more contexually aware information in a straightforward, digestible manner.

## Critique #2
<iframe title="'Big Three' Blamed for Most Attacks" aria-label="Interactive donut chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TRNNj" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TRNNj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="424"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

This redesigned visualization improves upon the original in the following ways:

1. Introduces only 3 shark types to the audience, rather than an overwhelming 33. 
2. Uses a donut chart to make shark type attacks easier to compare to one another and illustrate the dominance of the big three shark types. 
3. Explicitly writes the number of attacks by each shark type to make it more tangible and digestible.
