# Final Project: Women in Engineering

## Summary
Women are largely underrespresented in the engineering fields. This problem comes to light in undergraduate education and continues to grow in graduate education and employment. Although the presence of women in these fields has grown over the past few years, gender equality is still a ways away. In raising awareness around this issue, I hope to inspire the audience to become strong advocates for women in science and engineering and perhaps take steps towards alleviating this issue. 

## Project Summary
1. Introduce gender gap in engineering issue. 
2. In undergraduate studies, female students are slightly less likely to enroll in engineering programs than male students. 
3. In graduate studies, the gap between the number of male and female students widens. 
4. From bachelor engineering degrees to doctoral engineering degrees, the number of females that graduate is much less than the number of males that do so. 
5. This gender gap persists in engineering employment. There is much work to be done until gender equality is achieved in the professional engineering environment. 
6. Provide actionable suggestions as to how the read may be able to alleviate this issue. 

## Success Metrics
To measure user engagement and understandability, I will interview 3 people and ask them the following questions:
1. What are key take-aways from these data visualizations?
2. What do you like most about these data visualizations?
3. What do you find confusing about these data visualizations? How would you change those to improve them?
4. Is there anything else you wish to see along with these data visualizations?
5. Do you feel more inclined to take steps to alleviate gender gaps in engineering than you did prior to seeing this visualizations?

## Data Sources
I will be using 7 sets of data from data.world that are sourced from the National Science Foundation. I plan on using these datasets in the order they are listed below to tell the story about the gender gap in engineering throughout different levels of education and employment. 
1. Freshman Intentions (https://data.world/nsf/freshman-intentions-to-major-in-s-e-fields)
2. Undergraduate Engineering Enrollment (https://data.world/nsf/undergraduate-enrollment-in-engineering-programs)
3. Graduate Science & Engineering Enrollment (https://data.world/nsf/graduate-enrollment-in-s-e-fields)
4. Bachelors Degrees Awarded (https://data.world/nsf/bachelors-degress-in-s-e-fields-awarded)
5. Masters Degrees Awarded (https://data.world/nsf/masters-degress-in-s-e-fields-awarded)
6. Doctoral Degrees Awarded (https://data.world/nsf/doctoral-degress-in-s-e-fields-awarded)
7. Science & Engineering Employment (https://data.world/nsf/employed-scientists-engineers)

## Method and Medium
I plan on completing my final project using Shorthand. I will talk through the gender gap through varying levels of education and employment, then provide the reader with some actionable steps that they could take in their day-to-day lives to alleviate this issue. 

## User Research Protocol
### Target Audience
The target audience is employees of engineering and technology companies who have more than 3 years of experience. This audience has experience in the relevant industry and has enough years of experience to feel accountable for affecting change in the industry.

### Approach to Identifying Representative Interviewees
To identify representative interviewees, I selected males who have more than 3 years of experience in engineering and technology and are currently working in this industry. 

### Interview Script
1. What are key take-aways from these data visualizations?

3. What do you find confusing about these data visualizations? How would you change those to improve them?
4. Is there anything else you wish to see along with these data visualizations?
5. Do you feel more inclined to take steps to alleviate gender gaps in engineering than you did prior to seeing this visualizations?

### Interview Findings

#### Interview A 
1. What are key take-aways from these data visualizations?
  - women are underrepresented in engineering throughout the entire process of becoming an engineer. 
2. What do you like most about these data visualizations?
  - I like that there were different types of graphs, that kept me engaged. 
3. What do you find confusing about these data visualizations? How would you change those to improve them?
  - I didn't find anything confusing about the visualizations. 
4. Is there anything else you wish to see along with these data visualizations?
  - I would like to see more structure to the page. Perhaps a key takeaway for each graph or a section title would help. 
5. Do you feel more inclined to take steps to alleviate gender gaps in engineering than you did prior to seeing this visualizations?
  - I didn't realize that the bottom part was a call to action. It seems more like an ending that I don't need to pay           attention to. Perhaps a section title would help here as well. 
  
#### Interview B
1. What are key take-aways from these data visualizations?
  - I'm surprised: I thought there were more women in engineering. 
2. What do you like most about these data visualizations?
  - They show the gaps well: Overlaying both male and female on the same visualization shows the difference clearly. 
3. What do you find confusing about these data visualizations? How would you change those to improve them?
  - Not much
4. Is there anything else you wish to see along with these data visualizations?
  - I would like to see what kinds of fields females are going into if they are not going into engineering. For example, what   is most common major that females are enrolled in? 
5. Do you feel more inclined to take steps to alleviate gender gaps in engineering than you did prior to seeing this visualizations?
  - I feel like actions are 
  towards women in the industry, not towards me. 
  
#### Interview C
1. What are key take-aways from these data visualizations?
  - My overall impression is that there is a significant gap/disconnect between the number of women in engineering and the       number of men in engingeering (both in education and in professional work place). 
2. What do you like most about these data visualizations?
  - I liked visualization about higher education degrees awarded the most because it showed me 3 different datasets in a concise manner. 
3. What do you find confusing about these data visualizations? How would you change those to improve them?
  - In the visualization about higher education degrees awarded, due to the differences between males and females, it was hard   to tell the trends for each individual one. 
  - Similarly for other charts, it can be difficult to see the change/trend overtime. 
4. Is there anything else you wish to see along with these data visualizations?
  - For the first visualization, the total value for all people would be helpful. 
  - It would be helpful to get context around women in the workforce overall (or in STEM)? 
  - It would be cool to see these trends from even earlier (i.e. elementary school) to see if this gap increases as they get     older. 
  - After just reading the title, I thought it was about the gender pay gap in engineering, not just absolute numbers of         females in engineering. Perhaps facts around the gender pay gap would be interesting. 
  - Maybe make this story about one specific female (i.e. Sara) to make it more engaging and easier to follow. 
5. Do you feel more inclined to take steps to alleviate gender gaps in engineering than you did prior to seeing this visualizations?
  - I didnt know that these were actional steps. I'm not sure what this section is. Perhaps a section title would help. 
  - I didn't know that there were two links there. I think that's cool. Perhaps they can be made more obvious
  - I'm not sure how I can tell stories and how to opportunities to mentor young women. Perhaps links can be made available     for these as well. 

### Implemented Changes to Address the Identified Issues
1. Added titles to each section to make flow clear. Make sure the title for actions at the bottom makes clear that they apply to anyone working in engineering and technology (not just females).
2. Added total value to first visualization. 
3. Added Growth Rate to 'Engineering Undergraduate Enrollment" and "Higher Education Engineering Degrees Awarded" to make the growth rate over time more clear. 
4. Added some statistics in description around percentage of all female in the workforce to give more context around women in  the engineering workforce compared to all women in the workforce. 
5. Updated actions towards bottom of page to make these more understandable and actionable and ensure that links are clear.

### Final Data Story
Creating this data story involved a series of learnings. Firstly, after some reflection and research, I chose to focus on employees in the engineering industry because they would be likely to take the actionable steps and have more impact than others would. Given that the target audience would be a technical, evidence-based audience, I chose to include many statistic my text as well: they seemed to respond positively tho this. Secondly, the more challenging and important learning throughout this process has been filtering data and details to make this an easy-to-understand, enjoyable story while inspiring action. Throughout my research, I found that different people have different preferences and while implementing user feedback is important, I had to make sure to not let these small changes did not affect the seamlessness or overall continuity and structure of my story. This involved several iterations in both data visualization, text provided, and even images and headings.
